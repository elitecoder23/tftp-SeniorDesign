= Common Concepts and Setup

== Introduction
TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is a simple file transfer protocol that allows clients to send and receive files from a server.
Despite its simplicity, TFTP remains widely used in scenarios where basic file transfer functionality is required, particularly in network booting, firmware updates, and configuration file transfers.

=== Basic TFTP Characteristics
* **Connectionless Protocol**: TFTP operates over UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
* **Simple Design**: No authentication or complex handshaking mechanisms
* **Fixed Block Size**: Traditional TFTP uses 512-byte data blocks
* **Basic Operations**: Supports two main operations:
  ** Read File Operation (file download from server)
  ** Write File Operation (file upload to server)
