= TFTP Operations

<<rfc_1350>>

== File Reception (Download)
The file reception process follows these steps:

. Client sends a _Read Request_ (RRQ) to the server.
. Server responds with the first data block.
. Client acknowledges (ACK) the received block.
. The process continues until the final block (less than 512 bytes) is received.

== File Transmission (Upload)
The file transmission process involves:

. Client sends a _Write Request_ (WRQ) to the server.
. Server responds with an _Acknowledgment_ packet.
. Client sends the first data block
. Server acknowledges the received block
. The process continues until the final block (less than 512 bytes) is sent

== Error Handling
TFTP implements basic error handling through error packets.
Common error scenarios include:

- File not found
- Access violation
- Disk full
- Illegal TFTP operation
- Unknown transfer ID
- File already exists
- No such user
