== TFTP Client

The TFTP Client is a command-line application for transferring files to and from a TFTP server using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol.
It focuses on simplicity and standard compliance, making it suitable for tasks like firmware updates, boot images, and configuration file distribution.

- Performs TFTP Read (download) and Write (upload) operations with a remote server.
- Uses the standard TFTP “octet” (binary) transfer mode for exact byte-for-byte transfers.

Refer to <<manpage_tftp_client>> for a manual page.

=== Key features
* Read (RRQ) and Write (WRQ) operations:
** Read: downloads a remote file and stores it locally.
** Write: uploads a local file to a remote path on the server.
* Simple command-line interface:
** Remote server address
** Operation (Read|Write)
** Remote file path
** Optional local file path (if omitted during Read, the local filename defaults to the remote filename).
* Robustness controls:
** Configurable timeout and retry behavior for lossy or slow networks.
** Server port selection and optional “linger/dally” after transfer completion (to allow final acknowledgments in some environments).
* Status and diagnostics:
** Clear start-of-transfer summary indicating operation, endpoints, and filenames.
** End-of-transfer receive/transmit packet statistics to aid troubleshooting.
** Informative errors for typical TFTP conditions (file not found, access violation, disk full, illegal operation, unknown transfer ID, file exists, etc.).

=== Considerations and best practices
- TFTP provides no authentication or encryption; use only on trusted networks.
- Ensure the TFTP server has the necessary permissions and correct root directory configuration for the requested files.
- Check firewall rules for UDP and the server’s TFTP port.
- For large files or constrained networks, adjust timeout/retries accordingly.
