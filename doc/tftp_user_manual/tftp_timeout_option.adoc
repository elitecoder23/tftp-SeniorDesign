= TFTP Timeout Option

== Overview
The TFTP timeout option is a critical configuration parameter that determines how long a TFTP client or server should wait for a response before considering the transmission failed and initiating a retry.

== Purpose
- Ensures reliable data transfer by detecting lost or delayed packets
- Prevents indefinite hanging of transfers
- Allows customisation based on network conditions

== Technical Details
- Specifies the duration to wait for acknowledgement packets
- Applies to both read and write operations
- Typically measured in seconds or milliseconds
- Default timeout values vary by implementation

== Benefits
. Prevents transfer deadlocks
. Enables automatic retry mechanisms
. Allows tuning for different network conditions
. Helps in handling network congestion

== Configuration Considerations
- Should be set based on network latency
- Longer timeouts may be needed for:
- Slow or congested networks
- High-latency connections
- Networks with packet loss

- Shorter timeouts are suitable for:
- Local network transfers
- Low-latency connections
- Reliable networks

== Best Practices
. Set timeout values appropriate for your network environment
. Consider increasing timeout for transfers across WAN or Internet
. Use shorter timeouts for local network operations
. Account for network latency and potential congestion

== Limitations
- Too short timeouts may cause unnecessary retransmissions
- Too long timeouts can slow down recovery from failures
- Must balance between quick failure detection and avoiding premature timeouts

The timeout option is essential for reliable TFTP operations and should be configured appropriately based on the specific network environment and requirements.
