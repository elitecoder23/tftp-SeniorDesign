= TFTP Transfer Size Option

== Overview
The Transfer Size option is an extension to the TFTP protocol as defined in RFC 2349.
It allows the sending and receiving sides of a TFTP transfer to negotiate and communicate the size of the file being transferred before the actual transfer begins.

== Purpose
- Enables the receiving side to know the expected file size in advance
- Allows for better resource allocation and progress monitoring
- Helps in detecting incomplete transfers
- Improves transfer reliability

== Usage
The Transfer Size option is automatically handled by the TFTP implementation when supported by both client and server.
The option is negotiated during the initial request phase of the TFTP transfer.

== Compatibility
- Follows RFC 2349 specifications for TFTP options
- Backward compatible with TFTP implementations that don't support the transfer size option
- Works alongside other TFTP options like timeout interval

== Benefits
. Pre-allocation: Receiving side can pre-allocate required storage space
. Validation: Helps ensure complete file transfer
. Progress Tracking: Enables accurate progress monitoring during transfer
. Resource Management: Better memory and storage management

== Notes
- The transfer size is specified in bytes
- The option is optional and must be negotiated between client and server
- Both sides must agree to use the option for it to be effective
