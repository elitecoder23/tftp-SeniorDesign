[#tftp_blocksize_option]
= TFTP Blocksize Option

== Overview
The TFTP blocksize option is an extension to the TFTP protocol defined in RFC 2348.
It allows TFTP clients and servers to negotiate a block size different from the default 512 bytes for data transfers.

== Purpose
- Allows for more efficient transfers by using larger block sizes
- Helps optimise network performance
- Reduces the number of acknowledgement packets needed for large file transfers

== Technical Details
- The option is negotiated during the initial request (READ or WRITE)
- Default block size if not specified: 512 bytes
- The option is specified using the keyword "blocksize"
- The value must be specified as a string representing a decimal number
- Valid range: typically between 8 and 65464 bytes (implementation dependent)

== Implementation Notes
- The option is optional and must be negotiated between client and server
- Both parties must agree on the block size
- If the server does not support the requested block size, it may reject the option or propose a different value
- The negotiated block size remains in effect for the entire transfer session

== Benefits
. Improved transfer efficiency for larger files
. Reduced protocol overhead
. Better network utilisation
. Faster transfer speeds when using larger block sizes on reliable networks

== Limitations
- Both client and server must support the option
- Network conditions should be considered when choosing block size
- Very large block sizes may cause fragmentation at the IP level
- Must be within the implementation's supported range

This functionality is implemented according to RFC 2348 specifications and is one of the supported TFTP extensions in this implementation.
