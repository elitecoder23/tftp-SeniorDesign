== TFTP Server

The TFTP Server application provides a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) service over UDP for simple, lightweight file transfers.

Refer to <<manpage_tftp_server>> for a manual page.

=== Option Negotiation
- Block Size (blksize): Allows adjusting data block size (default 512 bytes) to optimize throughput.
- Timeout Interval (timeout): Negotiates per-packet timeout to better fit network latency.
- Transfer Size (tsize): Communicates the total size of the file, enabling progress tracking and resource planning.
- Behavior: The server replies with accepted values; unsupported options are ignored or defaulted per TFTP rules.

=== Error Handling

Uses standard TFTP error packets for conditions such as:
s
- File not found
- Access violation
- Disk full
- Illegal TFTP operation
- Unknown transfer ID
- File already exists
- No such user

Errors terminate the affected transfer with an explanatory code/message.

=== Typical Server Policies and Configuration

- Root directory (tftp-root) restricting accessible paths.
- Read/write permissions controlling downloads and uploads.
- File overwrite rules (e.g., prevent overwriting existing files) depending on configuration.
- Optional logging/diagnostics for transfers and errors.
- Bind address and port settings; potential chroot/sandboxing in production.

=== Operational Notes

- Best used on trusted networks or isolated environments due to lack of authentication and encryption.
- For performance, adjust block size and timeouts according to network conditions.
- Ensure adequate filesystem permissions and space, especially for uploads.
