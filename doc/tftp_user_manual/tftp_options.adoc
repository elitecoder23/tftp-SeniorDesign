= TFTP Options

== Introduction

The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) supports various options that enhance its functionality while maintaining backward compatibility RFC 2347.
These options allow users to customise file transfers according to their specific needs and network conditions.

== Understanding TFTP Options

TFTP options are extensions to the basic protocol that enable additional features and optimisations.
The option negotiation mechanism allows clients and servers to agree on specific transfer parameters before beginning the actual file transfer.

== Key Options Available

1. **Block Size Option**
- Allows customisation of the data block size
- Default block size is 512 bytes
- Can be adjusted for better performance on different networks

2. **Timeout Interval Option**
- Enables specification of the timeout interval
- Helps in managing network latency
- Useful for optimizing transfer reliability

3. **Transfer Size Option**
- Allows the sender to specify the total size of the transfer
- Helps in resource allocation and progress monitoring
- Enables better transfer management

== Option Negotiation Process

1. The client includes desired options in the initial request
2. The server responds with accepted options
3. If the server doesn't support an option, it may:
- Reject the unsupported option
- Continue with default values
- Propose alternative values

== Benefits of Using TFTP Options

- **Improved Performance**: Customisable block sizes and window sizes can significantly improve transfer speeds
- **Better Control**: Timeout and transfer size options provide better control over the transfer process
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Option negotiation ensures compatible settings between client and server
- **Backward Compatibility**: Servers that don't support options can still function with basic TFTP operations

== Best Practices
. Start with default values unless there's a specific need for customisation
. Consider network conditions when setting block sizes and window sizes
. Use appropriate timeout values based on network latency
. Test option combinations to find optimal settings for your environment
